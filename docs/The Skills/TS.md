<h1 style="text-align: center;"> The Souls</h1>

**The Helpless Souls of Deathburgh** remain blissfully unaware of the true origin of the force that grants them extraordinary abilities and an unnervingly prolonged life. They believe it stems from a **mystical essence** that pervades their world—an ethereal vitality that flows from ancient places of power and collects in enclosed spaces. By habit, they attribute it to the Souls. 

Some believe this force is a gift from those who have attained the fabled **True Death**, while
others suspect it to be a more earthly mystery—beyond mortal comprehension yet woven into
the very fabric of their world.

To represent this power, Players keep **Soul’s Dice** in a dedicated reserve known as the Soul’s Pool. There is no limit to the number of Soul’s Dice a player may store, allowing for strategic use of this energy at any point in the game.

The game of The Utterly Unfortunate-and somewhat ridiculous- Misadventures of the
Helpless Souls of **Deathburgh** uses Souls’s Dice as supplement dice to perform Skills or improve your dice roll. Before and throughout the development of the Round, the players will obtain what will be known as Soul's Dice.

Players keep Soul’s Dice in ‘storage’—known as the Soul’s Pool—to use at any point during the
game. There’s no limit to how many Soul’s Dice a player can store.
