<h1 style="text-align: center;"> How to use Soul’s Dice</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <b>Casting Skills</b></p>

In Deathburgh you may spend your Soul’s Dice to perform Skills.
If the player has the necessary number of Soul’s Dice to perform the Skill, the Skill is
automatically casted.

<p style="text-align: center;"> <b>To Ensoul a roll</b></p>


You can ensoul your dice for greater effects. Each Soul’s Dice can be spent to change the result of any single die (D6) to a 6 (6!), guaranteeing a critical success. However, each roll may only
be modified once, and the use of a Soul’s Dice must be declared before the roll is done. You can only modify dice that are to be rolled.

<p style="text-align: center;"> <b>Soul Dice are not rolled; they are simply removed from the Soul Pool.</b></p>


<p style="text-align: center;"> <b> Declare your intentions</b></p>


**Remember**: Any time you want to add Soul’s Dice to a roll, make sure to declare it loud and
clear before picking up those dice for the roll. Once your opponent’s been informed, roll them
all at once and let fate take over!

<p style="text-align: center;"> <b> Casting Skills</b></p>

When a player uses Soul’s Dice to perform a skill or modify a roll, then the player must remove the used Soul’s Dice from its Soul’s Pool.</b></p>


❖ If there’s a disagreement about who gets to modify rolls first, the player with the 'First
Word' always has the priority to make their modifications before the other player.

❖ If this player declines to modify their roll and the opponent does want to modify it,
they cannot retract it when they know their opponent's intentions, keep it real.
