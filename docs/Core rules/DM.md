<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Defensive Mode</h1>

When the miniature has already been activated, either after your turn ends, by an opponent’s action or by a reaction, the miniature will change to **Defensive Mode.**

The miniature must perform any future reaction following the attributes of the Defensive Mode in their miniature profile until the end of the Round.
Certain miniatures are better equipped for Defensive Mode. While this might seem like a disadvantage, some miniatures actually become more dangerous and lethal at close range or stay extra alert after taking an initial action—making Defensive Mode their strength for reactions.
