<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Miniature activation</h1>

This is a tabletop game where **players take turns** controlling one miniature at a time. 

To play, simply announce which miniature you’re activating before making any moves or actions on
your turn.

When you activate a miniature, you control it until the end of your turn. Then, your opponent will activate one of their miniatures to play with.

A miniature can also be activated during your opponent’s turn if certain conditions are met—such as when it’s under attack.
