<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Aggressive Mode</h1>

In Deathburgh, all miniatures can operate in one of two unique modes: **Aggressive** or
**Defensive**. 

All the miniatures are in Aggressive Mode at the beginning of the Round or when they have not been activated yet.

When you activate a miniature, it can take actions or reactions according to its Aggressive Mode attributes listed in its profile. 

When your miniature is in **Aggressive Mode**, it’s essentially in a state of readiness—full of momentum, focus, and ready to go. Even if it seems to be standing perfectly still on its (hopefully painted!) base. It actually represents movement and dynamism in the game.

So, it makes sense that aiming at someone in motion would be trickier, or that if your miniature is about to charge another in Aggressive Mode, the target might either try to Flee or countercharge first.
