<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Line of sight</h1>
In Deathburgh, each miniature enjoys a full 360º view and movement range. To target an opponent’s miniature, it must fall within this view. Simply draw a straight line from the base of your attacking model to any part of the target—whether base or body. Just watch out for obstacles that fully block your line of sight, as they’ll stop you in your tracks. Friendly or opponent’s miniatures, however, won’t interfere, so aim freely!
