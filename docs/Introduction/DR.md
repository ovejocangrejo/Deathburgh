<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Dice Rolls</h1>

In Deathburgh, you’ll be using ordinary six-sided dice (referred to as D6 throughout this rulebook). When it’s time to roll, grab the number of dice needed for the action, based on your miniature’s profile—and let the luck (or misfortune) begin!

Every now and then, modifiers will come into play and spice up your dice rolls. You may Reroll an already rolled dice based on specific situations or status. Along this rulebook you may find it abbreviated as RR.

But remember, you can’t re-roll a die that’s already been re-rolled

You may have an **Instant Critics**, when you must replace a die that has not been rolled yet for an instant success with a value of 6. Along this rulebook you may find it abbreviated as **6!**

Finally, you may also have an Instant Failure, when you must replace a dice that has not been rolled yet for an instant failure with a value of 1. Along this rulebook you may find it abbreviated as **1!**

If a rule creates a conflict between applying an Instant 6! or an Instant 1! to a die, the Instant 1! always takes priority. This means that if no additional dice are rolled, any die that could be
an Instant 6! is instead treated as an Instant 1!, regardless of the situation.
