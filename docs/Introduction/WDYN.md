<h1 style="text-align: center;"> What do you need?</h1>

As for equipment, to play Deathburgh you’ll need a set of six-sided dice, a tape 
measure or ruler, some terrain pieces, and—naturally—a nice, flat playing area. (For 
heaven’s sake, keep it level!). 

The playing area is split into deployment zones and the main battle zone, where all 
the poor souls will scrap, scuffle, and try to make it out with as many limbs intact as 
possible.

To make it easier to play, you may also need a set of tokens to represent certain 
actions or status of your miniature. You can create your own or use the ones provided 
by Highlands Miniatures.

A bit of old-school pen and paper can make your gaming experience much easier! 
Sometimes it’s best to jot down your miniature’s name and key info to keep the 
battlefield a little tidier (and save yourself from drowning in tokens).
