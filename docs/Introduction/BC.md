In Deathburgh, **communication and friendly resolution are key**. Let the miniatures handle the insults and scuffles for a change, while we kick back and share a good laugh with your friends.

If this is your first wargame, some of these rules might be new to you, but they’re here to ensure everyone has a good time. So, before making any moves, positioning a miniature, or launching an attack, please communicate with your opponent so that everyone knows what
your intention is—keep things clear and fun for both sides!

To clarify, when a rule refers to an "attack," it applies to all types of attacks, including reactions and actions, melee and ranged. If further specification is needed, it will be provided in the rule
itself. For example, "Next turn" refers to the next turn taken by any player. If the Attacker is granted a double turn by a rule, the second turn is considered the "next turn" after the first, not necessarily the opponent’s next turn, but simply the next turn in sequence.

Of course there will be some times when you cannot find a resolution to a specific game situation within the rules of this manual, but don’t panic! In those cases, both players should agree to a friendly resolution -and stick to it for the rest of the game- based on these rules or your own ones.
