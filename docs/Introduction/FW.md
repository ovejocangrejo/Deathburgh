First Word is a term that refers to the player who has priority at the moment. Generally, the Attacker, the player who starts the first round, will be the player who has the First Word during their turn, after which they will pass the First Word to their opponent, who will pass it back to them at the end of their turn. We usually use a coin at the start of the round to pass it to each other so that it is easier to know who is in the lead at all times.
