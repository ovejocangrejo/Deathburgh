<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Combat Resolution</h1>

In Deathburgh, a Combat Resolution settles a Combat between miniatures. The Attacker is theminiature initiating the Attack action, while the Defender is the miniature on the receiving end.

<p style="text-align: center;"><b> A critic happens when your result is a 6. Each critical counts as 2 successes
</b></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>1) Combatant Modes</b></p>

The Attacker will generally be in Aggressive Mode, starting the
combat It will announce its attack action. The Defender may be in either Defensive Mode (if it has already been activated) or Aggressive Mode (if it has not yet been activated) it will announce its attack reaction or dodge reaction. At the end of the combat, both miniatures switch to Defensive Mode.

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>2) Prepare the Dice</b></p>

Each player gathers their D6 dice based on the Aggressiveness (A)
first attribute if in Aggressive Mode, or the Defence (D) first attribute if in Defensive Mode, as noted in their miniature’s profile.

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>3)Priority - The “First Word”</b></p>

The Attacker, with priority (known as the “First Word”), must first announce if they wish to spend a Soul’s Dice to add to the rolls, along with declaring any bonuses or Skill activations

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>4. Defender’s Turn</b></p>

Next, the Defender declares any additional Soul’s Dice, bonuses, or
Skills they’ll use. Once both players are set, they roll their dice simultaneously.

### Determine Successes:

After all attacks and reactions are declared, along with bonuses and special rules, resolve combat as follows:

        <li> For the Attacker, each D6 roll that meets or exceeds their Aggressiveness (A+) second value (if in Aggressive Mode) or Defence (D+) second value (if in Defensive Mode) is a Success. Anything less is a Fail.
            <li> For the Defender, each D6 roll that meets or exceeds their Aggressiveness (A+) second value (if in Aggressive Mode) or Defence (D+) second value (if in Defensive Mode) is a Success. Anything less is a Fail.
                <li> Announce Successes: The Attacker announces their number of Successes first, followed by the Defender. This is contested roll.
