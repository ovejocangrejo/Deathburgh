<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Rounds and Turns</h1>

Each game of Deathburgh is divided into several Rounds and Turns. In each Turn a player will
move and perform any action or reaction with a single miniature in alternance with the player
opponent.
- A miniature Turn is finished when it cannot perform any other action.
- A Round is finished when all the miniatures in the battlefield have been played. The
basic game of Deathburgh is designed to last four Rounds.
