<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Ranged Dodge Bonuses</b></h1>

These bonuses only apply if your model is declared as a valid target for receiving a Ranged Attack and your model's reaction is to Dodge those attacks. These bonuses are also stackable. But you can not get the same bonus twice.


<h2 style="text-align: center;">Take Cover</h2><div style= "text-align: center;">If your miniature is in ase-to-base contact with any terrain, obstacles, or other miniatures that are closer than you to your opponent, get 6! for free to your roll</div>

<p> <span class="resaltado">(15) KEEP IN MIND!<span class="tooltip">If your miniature is in contact with more than one piece of scenery that is at the same distance as the attacker or with a miniature, friend or enemy, you must choose which one it is "hiding" behind to receive the Take Cover bonus!

Agree with your opponent which terrains and
scenography can get this rule before the game starts
to avoid misunderstandings during the match. As
usual, we follow the rule that if the terrain is 1‚Äù high,
gives cover.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Get down!</h2><div style= "text-align: center;">If your miniature is targeted by a second ranged attack in the same round, get 6! for your roll.</div>
