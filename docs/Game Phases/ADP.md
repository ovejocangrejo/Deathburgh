To decide who takes the first move, both players roll a 1D6 at the same time. If you both end
up with the same result, keep rolling until someone finally breaks the tie and claims the first
action!

The player with the highest result gets to choose to be the attacker or the defender. The player with the lowest result gets one Soul’s Dice.

- In the first Round of the game, the Defender gets to choose the deployment zone and will deploy their miniatures first.

- The Attacker deploys the miniatures in second place but initiates the Turn Phase by activating a miniature in first place. The Turn Phase will continue as usual afterwards.

At the beginning of following Rounds, players will repeat this roll to determine the Attacker and the Defender. Remember the compensation Soul’s Dice for being the Defender.

The Attacker will initiate the Turn Phase by activating a miniature in first place. The Turn Phase will continue as usual afterwards.
