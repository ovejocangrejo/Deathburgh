Once all miniatures have been activated, the Round is over.

All miniatures must be in Defensive Mode by the end of the Round.

Players should check the battleground in order tokens or any other element of the battleground that must be removed before a new Round begins.

Remember to turn your miniatures into Aggressive Mode before the new Gathering Phase and let the next Round begin! Tokens can be handy for keeping track of each miniatureâ€™s Mode.
