<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Faction composition</h1>

Each faction is composed of different miniatures with different profile attributes. Also, each miniature plays a different role within the faction with its own unique skills. In Deathburgh, the bands are divided into the following miniatures, based on their roles and importance:

**● Basic troops**: Generally new recruits, fond of pillaging and warfare, the faction's least skilled warriors whose names and skills have yet to prove useful. There are two types, depending on their combat style, melee and ranged.

**● Brutes**: Dangerous. Very dangerous. These warriors are most effective at close range, standing their ground to receive an opponent’s onslaught rather than chasing them down. They’re a vital pillar in the faction’s composition, often recruited for guard and protection missions due to their sheer, imposing size.

**● Specialist**: The very best of each house. These are the fiery types, ready to take on the world—and knock out the first person who crosses their path. They’re a bit of a glass cannon, but on a lucky day, they pack enough punch to floor someone with a mere flick of the wrist.

**● Erudite**: The brains of the operation—or mostly. Probably older than the forest itself, these are the ones who claim they saw, knew, or had a cousin who met one of the Last Dead. Since then, something powerful has awakened within them—a force long
dormant in their souls, capable of turning the tide of battle. Still, they usually keep to the back row, letting the newer generations do the dirty work.

**● Leader**: The backbone of each faction. Seasoned in battle for generations, this
miniature has seen and endured so much that their mere presence fires up the hearts
of their followers. The ultimate embodiment of the faction, they’re the one most likely to emerge in one piece—or at least take more than a few by surprise in the attempt to make it out unscathed.
