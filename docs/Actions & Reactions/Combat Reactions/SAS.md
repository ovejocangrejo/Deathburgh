<h1 style="text-align: center;">Stand and Shoot Reaction</h1>
This reaction allows a miniature equipped with a ranged weapon to use it as a melee weapon for a single shoot against an opponent’s miniature in base contact. However, this is only permitted if:

### 1) The miniature was specifically charged by that opponent’s miniature.

### 2) It was not already in base contact with any other opponent’s miniature before being charged.

Essentially, the rule represents a last-ditch defence when unexpectedly engaged in close
combat. After the first combat that round, they must react with Dodge to all incoming attacks
from any source until they are away from melee combat again. This rules applies in both
modes, Aggressive and Defensive.
