<h1 style="text-align: center;">Reaction Ranged Attack</h1>

A miniature equipped with a <b>Ranged Weapon</b>, may respond to any enemy action, provided the action has fully resolved before the reaction is declared with a Reaction Ranged Attack If is in <b>Aggressive mode</b> and if is not in base-to-base with another enemy miniature.


- The target of a Reaction Ranged Attack must be within weapon range and in the Line of Sight (LOS) of the attacking miniature.
- When an opposing model completes an action (e.g., a <b>Move Forward</b> action), a friendly model with <b>Reaction Ranged Attack</b> may immediately declare a reaction against it.
- This reaction is resolved after the triggering action concludes, ensuring that all effects of the original action are applied before the reaction takes place.
- Only one <b>Reaction Ranged Attack</b> may be declared per triggering action.

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Ranged Duels</h1>

When two models with ranged weapons face off, they may engage in combat as if they were in melee. This means a Ranged Attack action can be countered with a <b>Reaction Ranged Attack</b>, creating a ranged duel.

- The target of a Reaction Ranged Attack must be <b>within the miniature's attack range.</b>

- If the target is <b>out of range or not in LOS,</b> the reacting model cannot fire back and may only attempt to Dodge the incoming attack instead.
