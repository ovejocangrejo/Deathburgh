<h1 style="text-align: center;">Reaction Ranged Attack</h1>

When two Ranged miniatures face off, they can engage in combat as if they were Melee miniatures. This means a Ranged Attack action can be countered with a Reaction Ranged Attack, resulting in a ranged duel. However, the target of a Reaction Ranged Attack must be within the miniature's range. If not, your miniature can only attempt to Dodge incoming
attacks.
