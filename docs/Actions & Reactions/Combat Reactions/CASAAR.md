If your miniature has a skill that can be cast as a reaction, it may do so in response to an opponentâ€™s action. A miniature can cast multiple skills as reactions during a turn, but cannot cast the same skill twice in the same turn. However, this restriction does not apply to different miniatures using the same skill.
