Control Points are areas of the board that your miniature can control in order to gain Victory
Points.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Control Zone</h2>

Each Control Point has a 3” diameter play area. A Control Point is under your control If it was unclaimed when one of your miniatures touches its border with its base. After that, a Control Point will remain under your control until an opponent's miniature claims.

If both you and your opponent have miniatures at a Control Point, the player with the higher Wounds (W), at that moment, wins control—so bring your toughest fighters! This means in the event of a conflict, the point will remain, or become controlled, by the model, or set of models, whose current lives are higher at the time the point is disputed.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Setting Up Control Points</h2>

A Control Points should be in the centre of the board, or as close as possible. Afterwards, there should be more or less even on the board. Leaving enough space between points to try to cover all the battle area.
You and your opponent can add as many Control Points as you like, but five is a good number and anything less than three a bit odd.

**Terrain Rules:** No Obstacles or Impassable Terrain allowed within a Control Point! Keep these
spaces clear for battle.
