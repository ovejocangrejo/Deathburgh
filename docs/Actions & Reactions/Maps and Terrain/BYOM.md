Finding the perfect play space isn’t always easy, so don’t stress if your board’s measurements differ—just make sure you’ve marked the centre for Control Points and that deployment areas are 30” apart.

For a good terrain recipe, we recommend including at least two or three pieces of Impassable
Terrain, one piece of Difficult Terrain, and six or more Obstacles. As long as both players agree
on what each piece represents, feel free to use any terrain pieces you like.

Get creative! Customize your board and terrain pieces however you want and show off those
crafting skills
After placing the terrain, place the Control Points evenly on the board. Note that neither of you
know where the game is going to start yet, so try to agree with your opponent on a placement
that you both agree on

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Terrain Placement rules if needed</h2>

Before deployment, players take turns placing terrain pieces on the battlefield. Each player places one piece per turn until a total of D6 + 4 terrain pieces are on the battlefield. There must be more obstacles than impassable terrain, and more impassable terrain than difficult terrain.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Control Points Placement rules if needed</h2>

If you need rules for Control Point Placement: Before deployment, each player rolls a D3 + 2 to determine the total number of Control Points on the battlefield. Players take turns placing one Control Point at a time until all have been placed. The player who rolled the highest places the first Control Point. In case of a tie, roll off.
<body>
<ol>
    <li><b>Deployment Zone Proximity</b>
        <ol>One Control Point must be as close as possible to the centre of the board.
</ol>
        <ol>At least one Control Point must be within 7” of each deployment zone.
</ol>    
        <ol>At least one Control Point must be more than 13” from each deployment zone.
</ol>
    <li><b>Spacing Between Control Points</b>
        <ol>Control Points cannot be placed more than 20” apart from each other.
        </ol>
        <ol>Control Points must be at least 7” apart from one another
</ol>
    <li><b>Measurement Rules</b>
        <ol>Always measure distances from the centre of each Control Point to ensure accurate placement.
        </ol>
        <ol>Can form blocking lines but should not fully separate the battlefield.
</ol>
    </li></li></li>
