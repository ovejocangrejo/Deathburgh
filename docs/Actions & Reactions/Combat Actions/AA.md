<h1 style="text-align: center;">Attack Action</h1>

When your miniature Attacks, it initiates a **Melee Combat.** You’ll kick off the fight by performing an Attack action in Aggressive Mode. If you’re on the receiving end, you can strike
back with a reaction Attack.

This back-and-forth is what we call Melee Combat!

Each attack will be resolved through a Combat Resolution. A successful attack may cause wounds or inflict other damage, depending on your faction abilities.

**Remember**, each miniature can only action attack one opponent’s miniature in their turn.

A miniature can perform an Attack in either Aggressive Mode or Defensive Mode. Once a miniature engages another in an Attack, they’re locked in Melee Combat until one of them falls—or combat ends.
