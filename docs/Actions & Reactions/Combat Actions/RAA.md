<h1 style="text-align: center;">Ranged Attack Action</h1>

Work the same way that the Melee combat but a Range model has to get a weapon attached despite as Ranged in order to perform a Range Attack Action or a Range Attack Reaction. A Ranged weapon always has attached a range value. 

To declare an action, the target of that action declared needs to be within the range value of the weapon.
