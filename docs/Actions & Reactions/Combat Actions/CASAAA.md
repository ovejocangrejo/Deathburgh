<h1 style="text-align: center;">Casting a Skill as an Action</h1>

If your miniature has a skill that requires a cost to be cast, it can be used as an action during its turn. A miniature can cast multiple skills per turn, but cannot cast the same skill twice in the same turn. However, this restriction does not apply to different miniatures using the same skill.
