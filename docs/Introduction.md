<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Who's in Deathburgh?</h1>

Deathburgh is played through factions. A faction, a band, a cult, a group of crazy lads, is a set of
miniatures from the same fantasy aesthetic or theme. Each faction has its own unique rules
and special actions to carry out and win the game. You may also win by achieving the victory
conditions available in certain maps.


Players pick their faction and prepare to square off against others—just don’t go picking your
own faction as the opponent! But don’t fret, we’re crafting plenty of factions and fine folks, all
ready to blow each other’s faces off for reasons both incredibly sensible and utterly ridiculous.
