<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Skills & Soul’s Dice</h1>

Skills are **unique abilities** that actively or passively come into play during the game. Each miniature and each faction has its own set of unique skills listed by name and description in the miniature’s profile.

Typically, a Skill has a number between brackets before its name indicating the number of Soul’s Dice needed to activate it.


**➔** You can cast a skill during your turn, in your miniature activation, as an action or during
an opponent turn, during your miniature reaction, as a 
reaction. 

**➔** A skill cannot be used twice in the same Round by the same miniature.
