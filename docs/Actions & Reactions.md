<p style="text-align: center;"><b> What to do in a Turn
</b></p>

Each miniature can perform actions during their Turn Phase and reactions during opponent Turn Phase. Actions and reactions may be more or less effective depending on your miniature, if it is in Aggressive Mode or Defensive Mode.


<p style="text-align: center;"><b> Action and Reactions</b></p>

Miniatures can only perform one action at a time, and the same action cannot be repeated in the same turn, with the same miniature, unless a skill or rule allows it.

Reactions can only be performed in response to an opponent’s action—never to another reaction. Each miniature can react only once per action, meaning:

● No chain reactions.

● No multiple miniatures reacting to the same action.

● No reacting with two different responses to the same action.

This reflects the fast-paced nature of combat and the limited time to react.
During a miniature's turn, it can perform any number of **actions**, as long as conditions allow.

<p style="text-align: center;"><b> Actions </b></p>

● Movement Actions: Move Forward, Charge.

● Combat Actions: Attack, Ranged Attack, or casting a Skill.

● Faction-Specific Actions: Unique to each faction.

Miniatures can also respond to actions with **reactions**, provided the conditions are met:

<p style="text-align: center;"><b> Reactions </b></p>

● Movement Reactions: Flee, Ambush, Flee under fire!

● Combat Reactions: Reaction Attack, Dodge, Reaction Ranged Attack, Stand and Shoot, casting a Skill as a reaction.
