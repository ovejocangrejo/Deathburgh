<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Melee Combat Bonuses</h1>

Certain situations grant an Attacker or Defender a Combat Bonus for replacing the dice to be rolled during Melee Combat for automatic 6! These bonuses are also stackable. But you can not get the same bonus twice.

## Charge Bonus: 
The most common Combat Bonus occurs when a miniature Charges an
opponent. As outlined in the Charge rule, this grants the Attacker an 6! to their Aggressiveness (A) roll.

## Support Bonus:
Miniatures can also receive support from allies during Melee Combat,
giving an automatic 6! critical hit to the action or reaction roll if supported, only:
  
<h2 style="text-align: center;">If your miniature is in Defensive Mode, the supporting ally must be base-to-base with you.</h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">If your miniature is in Aggressive Mode, the ally must be base-to-base with your opponent.</h2>

These bonuses apply to whatever reaction or action is made by your miniature during a Melee Combat.

<b>➔ Support Limit:</b> The maximum support a miniature can receive depends on how many
allies can be base-to-base with the miniature, performing or receiving the action.

<b>➔ Skill-Based Bonus:</b> Certain Skills from other miniatures may also grant a Combat Bonus
