<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Maps and Terrain</h1>

Every Deathburgh game is played over a certain Map. The Map is where all the action takes
place.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Board and Deployment zones</h2>

Deathburgh is designed to be played on a 3’ x 3’ board. There are two deployment zones, one on each side of the board, each measuring 3" x 36" and starting from the board’s edge.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Likewise, a Melee miniature can only dodge incoming ranged attacks </h2>

**● Obstacles**: Obstacles are small terrain pieces that miniatures can see and move through, but with a little extra effort. Moving through an Obstacle costs your miniature 2” of Movement (M) to get from
one side to the other. Obstacles should be small, like barrels, barricades, fences, crumbled walls, or bits of ruins.

**● Difficult Terrain**: Difficult Terrain slows your miniatures down. When entering Difficult Terrain, your miniature’s move is capped at 2” as long is in for this turn. After traveling 2" in this terrain you must stay
in place and your miniature’s movement will be over for this turn. If your miniature is already inside the terrain at the start of its turn, it can move freely. Think of swampy patches, marshes, mud, rocky ground, or steep slopes.

**● Impassable Terrain**: Impassable Terrain is as it sounds—your miniature can neither move through nor see through it. These large obstacles, like ruined buildings, high walls, or massive equipment, are perfect for opponent’s miniatures to hide behind, ready to spring an Ambush.
