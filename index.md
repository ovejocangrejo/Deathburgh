Welcome to Deathburgh, a new tabletop game for two or more players developed 
by [Highlands Miniatures](https://www.patreon.com/c/highlands_miniatures/posts) for collecting, painting and gaming the exclusive miniatures 
of Deathburgh.

Deathburgh, a combination of the word Death -the main topic of the game- and the 
scottish word -burgh, is set in an alternative universe where Death is no longer a thing.

The atmosphere of the game and main inspiration for the city and its spaces is based 
on Highlands Miniatures hometown, Edinburgh (Scotland), and its multilayered city 
center, in a combination of steampunk and fantasy aesthetic.

Within the pages of this [rulebook](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1VxBlVB5Wp7C4RegCmNbfRIrIS_41GeVY), you will discover the world behind Deathburgh and 
how to play the game. To get started in Deathburgh, well you need miniatures, of 
course! You can use any miniatures you like to play Deathburgh but try at least to
paint them!
